After two years working with Gatsby.js, I decided to try another web framework: Astro

The main reason for the migration is: I was unable to migrate the old project for the newest version of Gatsby. Maybe it's my fault! I been trying to do the migration, but after a lot of issues (older versions of components, pipelines broken, etc.), I decided to migrate for a new framework.

(Astro)[https://astro.build] is very similar to Gatsby. I pick a free template [Pinwheel theme](https://github.com/themefisher/pinwheel-astro) to have some work done. With the pass of the versions, I'll change more and more of the style and the theme work.

The migration is not only in the code, I change the provider. I had some issues with the DNS management. As today I have disabled the mail server, in a future release I'll change that situation and remove the generic email.
